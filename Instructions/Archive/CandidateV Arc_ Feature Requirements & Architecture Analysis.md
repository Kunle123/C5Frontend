# CandidateV Arc: Feature Requirements & Architecture Analysis

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements and proposed architecture for the "Arc" feature within CandidateV. Arc aims to transform CandidateV from a simple CV/cover letter generator into a personalized career intelligence database. Instead of storing static CV files, Arc will extract, structure, and continuously refine a user's career information, leveraging this knowledge base alongside OpenAI GPT models to generate highly bespoke application materials tailored to specific job descriptions.

## 2. Core Requirements

1.  **CV Information Extraction**: Securely process uploaded CVs (various formats like PDF, DOCX) to extract structured career data (contact info, work experience, education, skills, projects, achievements, etc.). **Uploaded CV files must not be stored long-term.**
2.  **Career Intelligence Database (Arc)**: Store the extracted and user-refined career data in a structured, queryable format specific to each user.
3.  **Data Refinement Interface**: Allow users to review, edit, add context, and enhance the information stored in their Arc (e.g., adding specific achievements or metrics to a past role).
4.  **Job Description Analysis**: Process job descriptions provided by the user (e.g., pasted text or URL) to identify key requirements, skills, responsibilities, and company context.
5.  **Intelligent Matching**: Match the requirements identified in the job description against the user's data stored in the Arc.
6.  **Bespoke Application Generation**: Generate tailored CVs and cover letters using the matched information from the Arc and the job description specifics, ensuring relevance and keyword optimization.
7.  **Format Flexibility**: Allow generation of application materials in common formats (e.g., PDF, potentially DOCX).
8.  **AI Integration**: Leverage OpenAI GPT models for extraction, analysis, matching assistance, and content generation.
9.  **Security & Privacy**: Ensure user data is stored securely, processed privately, and access is strictly controlled. Adhere to data privacy regulations.

## 3. Proposed Architecture

A modular architecture, potentially using microservices or well-defined service modules within a monolith, is recommended to handle the distinct processing tasks.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Frontend (Web Application)**: User interface for uploading CVs, managing Arc data, inputting job descriptions, initiating generation, and viewing/downloading results.
2.  **Backend API Gateway**: Manages requests from the frontend, routes them to appropriate services/modules, handles authentication and authorization.
3.  **User Service**: Manages user accounts, authentication, and profile information.
4.  **CV Processing Service**: Handles CV uploads, parsing (using libraries like `python-docx`, `pypdf`), and orchestrates data extraction via the AI Integration Layer.
5.  **Arc Database Service/Module**: Manages the storage and retrieval of structured career intelligence data for each user. Includes logic for data validation and updates.
6.  **Job Analysis Service**: Processes input job descriptions, potentially scrapes URLs, and orchestrates requirement extraction via the AI Integration Layer.
7.  **Application Generation Service**: Orchestrates the matching process, prepares prompts for the AI Integration Layer using Arc data and job requirements, and formats the generated content.
8.  **AI Integration Layer**: A dedicated service/module responsible for managing all interactions with the OpenAI GPT API. Handles prompt engineering, API calls, response parsing, error handling, and potentially caching/cost management.
9.  **Database (Arc DB)**: Stores the structured career intelligence data. A NoSQL database (like MongoDB) could offer flexibility for evolving data structures, or a relational database (like PostgreSQL) with JSONB fields could also work.
10. **Task Queue (e.g., Celery, Redis Queue)**: Manages asynchronous tasks like CV processing and potentially complex application generation to avoid blocking user requests and handle potentially long-running AI interactions.
11. **File Storage (Temporary)**: Temporary storage for uploaded CVs during processing, ensuring they are deleted promptly after data extraction.

## 4. Data Flow Example (CV Upload)

1.  User uploads CV via Frontend.
2.  Frontend sends file to Backend API Gateway.
3.  API Gateway authenticates user, stores file temporarily, and triggers CV Processing Service via Task Queue.
4.  CV Processing Service picks up task, reads file content.
5.  CV Processing Service sends content to AI Integration Layer with instructions for data extraction.
6.  AI Integration Layer prompts GPT model to extract structured data.
7.  AI Integration Layer receives structured data, performs basic validation/formatting.
8.  CV Processing Service receives extracted data, sends it to Arc Database Service.
9.  Arc Database Service stores structured data associated with the user.
10. CV Processing Service deletes the temporary CV file.
11. Task Queue marks task as complete; potentially notifies user via Frontend.

## 5. Key Considerations

*   **Scalability**: Design services (especially AI interaction and processing) to scale independently.
*   **Cost Management**: OpenAI API usage can be expensive. Implement strategies like prompt optimization, caching, potentially using smaller models for simpler tasks, and providing usage feedback/limits to users.
*   **Data Structure**: The Arc database schema needs careful design to be flexible yet efficient for querying relevant experiences/skills.
*   **Prompt Engineering**: Significant effort will be required to design effective prompts for GPT to ensure accurate extraction, relevant matching, and high-quality generation.
*   **User Feedback Loop**: Incorporate mechanisms for users to correct extracted data and rate generated content to potentially fine-tune prompts or models over time.
