## 📝 LinkedIn Post Text

### Version 1: Personal & Story-Driven

```
I'm delighted to announce Candidate 5 — a tool I wish I'd had during my 20 years as a contractor. 🚀

For two decades, I rewrote my CV hundreds of times. Every new role meant 2+ hours tailoring my CV and cover letter to match the job description. I got good at it — learned how recruiters think, how ATS systems work — but I always thought: there has to be a better way.

That's why I built Candidate 5.

Here's what makes it different:

🎯 Evidence-Based Matching
Our RAG (Red/Amber/Green) keyword system shows you exactly which skills you match — with proof from your profile. No guesswork.

✨ Zero Fabrication Guarantee
Every statement is backed by your real experience. No exaggerated claims, no made-up achievements. Just your genuine story, optimally presented.

⚡ Smart Customisation
• Toggle sections on/off (achievements, competencies, certifications)
• Adjust CV length (short/medium/long) with priority filtering
• Trim work history with a slider
• See your match score before you apply

📊 Built for How Recruiters Actually Work
After 20 years of conversations with recruiters, I understand both sides. Candidate 5 helps you speak the language of ATS systems while staying authentic.

The Stats:
• 85%+ average match score
• < 8 minutes from job posting to tailored CV
• 100% evidence-based content

Try it free: candidate5.co.uk
(3 applications included — no credit card required)

Because writing a CV shouldn't take up half your evening. And your real experience deserves to be seen.
