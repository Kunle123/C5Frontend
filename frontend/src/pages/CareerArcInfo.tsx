      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">Career Arc</h1>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Your Professional Journey, Mapped and Managed</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Career Arc is more than just a feature – it's your personal career command center. Think of it as LinkedIn meets strategic planning, designed specifically for people who are serious about their professional growth.</p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What is Career Arc?</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Career Arc helps you build and maintain a comprehensive profile of your professional journey. Unlike a traditional CV that's static and one-size-fits-all, Career Arc creates a dynamic repository of your experiences, skills, and achievements that can be tailored for any opportunity.</p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Key Features</h3>
      <ul className="mb-4 list-disc pl-6">
        <li className="mb-2"><b>Experience Timeline:</b> Document every role, project, and achievement in chronological order. Include details you might forget later – specific metrics, technologies used, team sizes, budget responsibilities. This becomes your master reference for future applications.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><b>Skills Inventory:</b> Track both hard and soft skills as they develop. Note where you learned them, how you've applied them, and what results you achieved. This helps identify patterns and growth areas in your career.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><b>Achievement Bank:</b> Store quantified accomplishments with full context. Instead of remembering "I increased sales," you'll have "Increased regional sales by 34% over 18 months by implementing new client retention strategy, resulting in £2.3M additional revenue."</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><b>Goal Tracking:</b> Set short and long-term career objectives. Track progress, identify skill gaps, and plan your next moves strategically rather than reactively.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">How It Works with CV Creation</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">When you're ready to apply for a role, Career Arc becomes incredibly powerful. Instead of starting from scratch each time, you can:</p>
      <ol className="mb-4 list-decimal pl-6">
        <li>Select Relevant Experiences: Choose which roles and projects best match the opportunity</li>
        <li>Highlight Appropriate Skills: Emphasize the competencies most valued for that specific role</li>
        <li>Customize Achievements: Pick accomplishments that resonate with the job requirements</li>
        <li>Maintain Consistency: Ensure all your application materials tell the same story</li>
      </ol>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The Strategic Advantage</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Most people approach job searching reactively – they see a role, scramble to update their CV, and hope for the best. Career Arc users approach it strategically. They understand their professional narrative, can articulate their value clearly, and present themselves as intentional career builders rather than opportunistic job hoppers.</p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Real-World Example</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Take Emma, a project manager who used Career Arc for six months before her next job search. When a dream role appeared, she could quickly identify:</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 list-disc pl-6">
        <li>Three projects that demonstrated the exact leadership style the company valued</li>
        <li>Specific metrics that proved her ability to deliver results in similar environments</li>
        <li>Skills she'd developed that directly addressed challenges mentioned in the job description</li>
        <li>A clear narrative showing progression toward this type of role</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Her application wasn't just a list of jobs – it was a compelling case for why she was the right person at the right time.</p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Privacy and Control</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Your Career Arc profile is completely private. You control what information to include in each application and can create multiple versions for different career paths or industries. Nothing gets shared without your explicit permission.</p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Getting Started</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Building your Career Arc profile takes about 30 minutes initially, then just a few minutes each month to keep it updated. The investment pays off exponentially when you're ready to make your next career move.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Most users find the process of building their Career Arc profile enlightening in itself – it helps them recognize patterns, identify strengths they'd overlooked, and spot opportunities for growth they hadn't considered.</p>
