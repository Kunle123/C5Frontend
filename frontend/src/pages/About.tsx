      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">About Us</h1>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Our Story</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Back in 2023, our founder was helping a friend with their job search. Despite having impressive qualifications and years of experience, they kept getting rejected without even reaching the interview stage. That's when we discovered the harsh reality: most CVs never make it past the initial screening software.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">We spent months researching how Applicant Tracking Systems work, talking to recruiters, and understanding what really happens to your CV after you hit "submit." What we found was frustrating but not surprising – brilliant candidates were being filtered out because their CVs weren't optimized for the systems that scan them first.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">That's how Candidate5 was born. We're not just another CV writing service. We're a team of former recruiters, career coaches, and tech enthusiasts who got tired of watching great people miss out on opportunities because of outdated application methods.</p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">What Makes Us Different</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">We've been in your shoes. Our team includes people who've struggled with job searches, hiring managers who've seen thousands of applications, and developers who understand exactly how ATS systems think. This combination gives us insights that most services simply don't have.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Our approach is straightforward: we use technology to solve a technology problem. While other services focus on making your CV look pretty, we focus on making it work. Every CV we create is tested against the same systems that employers use, ensuring it gets seen by human eyes.</p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Our Mission</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">We believe everyone deserves a fair shot at their dream job. Your skills and experience should speak for themselves – not get lost in translation by screening software. That's why we're committed to leveling the playing field, one optimized CV at a time.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">We're not trying to game the system; we're helping you speak its language while staying true to your authentic professional story.</p>
