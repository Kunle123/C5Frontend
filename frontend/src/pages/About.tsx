      <p className="mb-4">Hi, I'm Kunle, the founder of Candidate 5.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">For over 20 years, I worked as a contractor across all kinds of industries. I must have written and rewritten my CV hundreds of times during that period. Every new role meant hours spent tailoring my CV and cover letter to match the job description, sometimes two hours or more for a single application.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">I got pretty good at it over time. I learned what recruiters look for, how job specs are written, and, most importantly, how Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) actually work. I picked up most of that knowledge the hard way â€” through trial, error, and a lot of conversations with recruiters over the years.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But I always thought there had to be a better way. Writing a CV shouldn't take up half your evening. Most people don't have the time or insider knowledge to know how to make their CV stand out or pass through an ATS.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">That's where the idea for Candidate 5 came from. I wanted to build a tool that could take what people already have; their real experience, skills, and achievements and turn it into a professional, tailored CV in minutes.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Candidate 5 is designed to take the pain out of the process. It helps you create a CV and cover letter that not only looks great but actually works with the systems recruiters use.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Because I've been there, I know how frustrating it can be. And I know how much of a difference the right CV can make.</p>
