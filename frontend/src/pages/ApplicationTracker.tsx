      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">Application Tracker</h1>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Never Lose Track of an Opportunity Again</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Job searching can feel chaotic. You're applying to multiple roles, following up with different contacts, and trying to remember which version of your CV you sent where. Application Tracker brings order to this chaos.</p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The Problem We're Solving</h3>
      <ul className="mb-4 list-disc pl-6">
        <li>Forgotten which jobs you've applied for?</li>
        <li>Lost track of application deadlines?</li>
        <li>Missed follow-up opportunities because you forgot when you applied?</li>
        <li>Applied to the same role twice by accident?</li>
        <li>Wondered why you never heard back, only to realize you never actually submitted the application?</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">If any of these sound familiar, you need Application Tracker.</p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What It Does</h3>
      <ul className="mb-4 list-disc pl-6">
        <li><b>Centralized Dashboard:</b> See all your applications in one place. Sort by date, status, company, or role type. Get a clear overview of your job search activity without digging through email folders.</li>
        <li><b>Status Tracking:</b> Monitor each application through its lifecycle: Applied, Application Reviewed, Interview Scheduled, Interview Completed, Offer Received, Rejected, Withdrawn.</li>
        <li><b>Automated Reminders:</b> Set follow-up reminders so you never miss an opportunity to check in. The system suggests optimal timing based on industry standards and company size.</li>
        <li><b>Document Management:</b> Keep track of which CV version and cover letter you sent for each role. This is crucial for interview preparation and ensures consistency in follow-up communications.</li>
        <li><b>Interview Preparation:</b> Store notes about each company, role requirements, and interview feedback. Build a knowledge base that helps you improve with each application.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Smart Features</h3>
      <ul className="mb-4 list-disc pl-6">
        <li><b>Duplicate Detection:</b> The system alerts you if you're about to apply for a role you've already applied for, preventing embarrassing duplicate applications.</li>
        <li><b>Company Insights:</b> Track patterns across companies – which ones respond quickly, which take longer, what their typical process looks like. This helps set realistic expectations and plan your pipeline.</li>
        <li><b>Success Analytics:</b> Understand your application success rate by industry, role type, company size, and other factors. Identify what's working and what needs adjustment.</li>
        <li><b>Follow-up Suggestions:</b> Get personalized recommendations on when and how to follow up based on the company, role level, and time since application.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The Psychology of Organized Job Searching</h3>
      <ul className="mb-4 list-disc pl-6">
        <li><b>Providing Perspective:</b> When you can see your entire pipeline, one rejection doesn't feel catastrophic. You remember that you have other opportunities in progress.</li>
        <li><b>Maintaining Momentum:</b> Clear next steps and reminders keep you moving forward instead of getting stuck analyzing why one particular application didn't work out.</li>
        <li><b>Building Confidence:</b> Tracking your progress shows improvement over time. You can see that your response rate is increasing or that you're getting further in the process.</li>
        <li><b>Reducing Anxiety:</b> Knowing exactly where everything stands eliminates the mental energy spent trying to remember details or worrying about missed opportunities.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Integration with Other Tools</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Application Tracker works seamlessly with your tailored CVs and Career Arc profile. When you apply for a role:</p>
      <ol className="mb-4 list-decimal pl-6">
        <li>Your tailored CV is automatically saved with the application record</li>
        <li>Relevant Career Arc information is linked for easy interview preparation</li>
        <li>Follow-up templates are pre-populated with the right details</li>
      </ol>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Getting Started</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Most users spend about 10 minutes setting up their tracker, then just 2-3 minutes per application to keep it updated. The time investment is minimal, but the peace of mind and improved organization are significant.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">You can import existing applications from your email or start fresh. Either way, you'll quickly wonder how you managed job searching without it.</p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Success Stories</h3>
