      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">ATS Proof</h1>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Beat the Bots, Reach the Humans</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Here's something that might shock you: 75% of CVs are rejected before a human ever sees them. Not because the candidates aren't qualified, but because their CVs can't communicate with the Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) that scan them first.</p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What Exactly is ATS?</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Think of ATS as a digital gatekeeper. When you apply for a job online, your CV doesn't go straight to a hiring manager's desk. Instead, it gets fed into software that scans for specific keywords, formats, and criteria. Only the CVs that "pass" this initial screening make it to human reviewers.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The problem? Most people write CVs for humans, not machines. They use creative formatting, graphics, or industry jargon that confuses the software. The result? Qualified candidates get filtered out automatically.</p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">How We Make Your CV ATS-Friendly</h3>
      <ul className="mb-4 list-disc pl-6">
        <li className="mb-2"><b>Keyword Optimization:</b> We analyze the job description and identify the exact terms the ATS is looking for. Then we naturally incorporate these keywords into your CV without making it sound robotic or stuffed.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><b>Format Testing:</b> Every CV template we use has been tested against major ATS platforms including Workday, Greenhouse, and Lever. We know which formats work and which ones cause parsing errors.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><b>Skills Matching:</b> Our system compares your experience against the job requirements and highlights the most relevant qualifications. This helps the ATS understand why you're a good fit.</li>
        <li className="mb-2"><b>Section Optimization:</b> We structure your CV with clear headings and logical flow that ATS systems can easily navigate. No hidden text, no fancy graphics that confuse the software.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Real Results from Real People</h3>
      <blockquote className="mb-4 border-l-4 border-primary pl-4 italic">"I was applying for months with no luck. After using Candidate5, I got three interview requests in the first week. Turns out my old CV was being filtered out before anyone saw it." - Sarah M., Marketing Manager</blockquote>
      <blockquote className="mb-4 border-l-4 border-primary pl-4 italic">"The difference was incredible. Same qualifications, same experience, but suddenly I was getting responses. It's like I finally learned to speak the language these systems understand." - James K., Software Developer</blockquote>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The Technical Stuff (For Those Who Want to Know)</h3>
      <ul className="mb-4 list-disc pl-6">
        <li>Parsing simulation using the same algorithms as major ATS platforms</li>
        <li>Keyword density analysis to ensure optimal but natural placement</li>
        <li>Format validation to prevent parsing errors</li>
        <li>Compatibility testing across different ATS versions</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">We don't just guess what works – we test it. Every month, we run hundreds of CVs through actual ATS systems to refine our approach and stay ahead of software updates.</p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Beyond Just Keywords</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">ATS optimization isn't just about stuffing keywords into your CV. Modern systems are getting smarter, looking for context and relevance. That's why our approach focuses on:</p>
      <ul className="mb-4 list-disc pl-6">
        <li>Natural language that flows well for human readers</li>
        <li>Relevant experience that genuinely matches the role</li>
        <li>Proper context around your achievements</li>
        <li>Authentic representation of your skills</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">The goal isn't to trick the system – it's to help it understand your true qualifications.</p>
